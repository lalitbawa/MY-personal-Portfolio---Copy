    <h1>What works</h1>
    1. If you click on Men on top navbar, it will take to you the men's pants section.
    2. If you click on the hamburger menu on the right hand side, you can click on men topwear and select tshirts or click on men bottom wear and select pants.
    3. If you open the website on mobile, you can use the carousel menu which is created from scratch.
    4. If you click on the filters button on tshirt or pants page, a menu will slide open from the left hand side in which you can select and use filters accordingly. all filter buttons work except reset filter button.
    5. You can click on the product image to view more details about that product.

    <h1>What's coming next</h1>
    1. I'm working on reset filters button which is will be added next.
    2. After that, i will add functionality to add to cart and remove from cart as well as a floating icon for cart.
    3. After that i will add payment page which will actually try to guess if the details entered are correct or incorrect as well as a payment sucessful page after that if the details(required digits, format etc.) are correct.
    4. After this, a new page named industry trends will be added which will use any free api available online to show fashion related news.
    5. Search bar will be added after it that will work across all products on website.
    6. A login/signup system will be created from scratch using spring after that.
    7. and more...........

    <h1>Known bugs</h1>
    1. If you are using carousel in a smaller display e.g. around 550px, it will misbehave if you strech the screen size to a larger desktop display without reloading. i'm working to fix this issue.
    2. If you face any other issues, please let me know at the earliest.
